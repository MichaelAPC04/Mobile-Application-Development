# Mobile-Application-Development - HD
_All assessments were completed individually in their entirety to time._

## Assessment 1 - HD
This assessment was about creating an event management system. The following concepts were implemented:
* Java and XML 
* Basic UI design
* Adding styles and themes
* Develop a multi-activity Android app (i.e. multiple Views)
* Save data to persistent storage (Shared Preferences)
* Listen to incoming SMS messages on a device
* Send a custom broadcast message for passing data from one Activity to Another

## Assessment 2 - HD
This assessment was about extending the event management system to enable users to create, manage, categorise and edit their events. The following concepts were implemented:
* An Options Menu to provide users with additional actions and settings
* A Navigation View is implemented for clear and consistent in-app navigation
* To promote user interaction, integrate Floating Action Buttons (FABs) for quick and accessible actions
* The application's core content will be structured using Fragments, a modular approach for managing different UI elements
* To display scrollable lists of data efficiently, leverage a Recycler View
* For persistent data storage, implement ArrayLists and SharedPreferences, allowing the app to save and retrieve data even after it's closed

## Assessment 3 - HD
This assessment was about further extending the event management system to make it as comprehensive as possible. The following concepts were implemented:
* Storing events & event categories using the Room Database library. This will allow you to understand how database CRUD (Create Read Update & Delete) operations work in a database
* Hosting external webpages within the app using WebView, without relying on the default web browser on the phone
* Using the embedded Google Map libraries to show a category's location on the Map and leverage Geocoder to decode user-provided input to a physical address
* Allowing users to interact with your app using Gestures. (by ingesting TouchEvent(s) and translating them into Android Gestures)
